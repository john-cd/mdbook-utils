## Images and badges

_Images_ can be inserted using `![Image alternative text](link/to/image.png)` or, reference-style, `![Image][1]` followed by a _reference definition_ `[1]: <http://url/b.jpg>`.

More details may be found in the [CommonMark][commonmark] documentation.

A status _badge_ is a small image that provides at-a-glance information, for example the build status of a code repository. Badges are commonly displayed on GitHub READMEs and inserted in `mdbook` documentation as links to a crate's [docs.rs][docs-rs] documentation, GitHub repo, or [crates.io][crates-io] page. More information about badges may be found in the [awesome-badges] repo and in the [shields.io][shields-io] documentation.

There is no "badge" concept in the Markdown specification. Badges are simply clickable images e.g. `[ ![image-alt-text](link-to-image) ](link-to-webpage)`.
